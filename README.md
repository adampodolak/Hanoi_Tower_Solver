This is a program I wrote in C to solve the famous Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.
<br />
The user can select how many rings to start with and the program will visually simulate the solution.
<br />
A gcc compiler is required to run the program.
<br />
Type 
`gcc -o hantow hantow.c`
In the project directory terminal
<br>
Then run: `hantow`
